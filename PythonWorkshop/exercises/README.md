# Exercises

 ### 1. Initiation üå±

Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).

 ### 2. Find The D (for dictionary) :trollface:

Write a function that returns a dictionary (i, i*i) between 1 and n.

 ### 3. The Matrices Begin üî¢

Write a function which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array.

The element value in the `i-th` row and `j-th` column of the array should be `i*j`.
Example for 3:
```
[0 1 2]
[1 1 2]
[2 2 4]
```

 ### 4. Follow the robots üîç

A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps.
The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:
```
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
```

The numbers after the direction are steps. Write a program to read directions from a text file and compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point.
If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.

Example:
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
```
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
```
Then, the output of the program should be: **`2`**

### 5. Literary Monster :books:

Write a program that, given a text file, prints the total number of words and the number of occurrences and percentage of each word in the file.
(Try it out with [lusidas.txt](https://github.com/ieeeupsb/workshop-python/blob/master/PythonWorkshop/exercises/lusiadas.txt))
The file with the contents:
```
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog?!. The
quick jumped brown sheep lol xd
```
Should ouput:
```
16
The: 2 occurences - 0.125%
quick: 2 occurences - 0.125%
brown: 2 occurences - 0.125%
fox: 1 occurences - 0.0625%
jumped: 2 occurences - 0.125%
over: 1 occurences - 0.0625%
the: 1 occurences - 0.0625%
lazy: 1 occurences - 0.0625%
dog: 1 occurences - 0.0625%
sheep: 1 occurences - 0.0625%
lol: 1 occurences - 0.0625%
xd: 1 occurences - 0.0625%
```

### 6. Do it with Class :tophat:

Write a class named `Shape`.
Write the classes `Circle` and `Rectangle`, which extend `Shape`.
Write the class `Square`, which extends `Rectangle`.

All these classes have a method that returns their `area`. For this to be possible, the classes' constructors must accept the necessary info (radius for Circle, side for square, ...)


### 7. Open exercise :warning:

This exercise should be used to fill time if you finish early (and for some reason don't want to leave yet (not that I want you to leave, please stay as long as you like :P)).
Write a text-based RPG game. This game can be as complex as you want it to. For inspiration please refer to [rpg.py](https://github.com/ieeeupsb/workshop-python/blob/master/PythonWorkshop/exercises/solutions/rpg.py) (you can actually play the game as well).

For a more complex example, refer to [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Game](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-game-30th-anniversary-edition)
